###Description
Performance Tuning of SQL Queries

###Starter Code (must be used)
See queries below

###Comment
Analyze query plans generated by the DBMS. Tune queries by using hints, adding indexes and rewriting queries. Explain how query plans change after tuning. Turn in before and after .sql files and query plans for six queries (given in English, see below). Do this for both the MySQL and PostgreSQL DBMSs: [MySQL](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/optimization.html) and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/internals.html). Present tuning experience and performance results including plots in class.
